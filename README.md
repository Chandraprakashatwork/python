Greetings viewer, I'm Chandraprakash! Today marks my first steps as a Kaggler, embarking on an exciting journey into the world of Machine Learning. I'm particularly drawn to automation through Machine Learning and currently focusing on learning Python for data science and tackling introductory Kaggle competitions.
I'm eager to connect with the Kaggle community, learn from experienced practitioners, and contribute to this vibrant infinite space. Let's explore the power of data together!
